	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	simulateCmd.Flags().StringVar(&interval, "interval", "5s", "interval between match requests, 10s, 1m, 5m")
	simulateCmd.Flags().IntVar(&playersPool, "players-pool", 10, "number of players to create matchmaking requests")
